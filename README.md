# FFFields

Fabulous front-end fields for Craft

![Banner](resources/img/banner.png)

FFFields gives you a complete toolkit to create fabulous front-end forms and dashboards. You can hook up your fields to Craft via the CraftQL plugin or roll your own solution, you choose.

This plugin makes use of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), but you don’t need to know either to use it.
